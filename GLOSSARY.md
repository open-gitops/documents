# GitOps Glossary {{version}}

This glossary accompanies the [GitOps Principles](./PRINCIPLES.md), and other supporting documents in this repository.

- ## Continuous

    "Continuous" is intended to match the industry standard term: [reconciliation](#reconciliation) continues to happen, not that it must be instantaneous.

- ## Declarative Description

    A configuration that describes the desired operating state of a system without specifying procedures for how that state will be achieved. This separates configuration (the desired state) from the implementation (commands, API calls, scripts etc.) used to achieve that state.

- ## Desired State

    The aggregate of all configuration data that is sufficient to recreate the system so that instances of the system are behaviourally indistinguishable.
    This configuration data generally does not include persistent application data, eg. database contents, though often does include credentials for accessing that data, or configuration for data recovery tools running on that system.

- ## Drift

    When a system's actual state has moved or is in the process of moving away from the [desired state](#desired-state), this is often referred to as drift.

- ## Reconciliation

    The process of ensuring the actual state of a system matches its [desired state](#desired-state).
    Contrary to traditional CI/CD where automation is generally driven by pre-set triggers, in GitOps reconciliation is triggered whenever there is a divergence. Divergence could be due to the actual state unintentionally [drifting](#drift) from the desired state declarations, or a new desired state declaration version having been changed intentionally.
    Actions are taken based on policies around [feedback](./GLOSSARY.md#feedback) from the system and previous reconciliation attempts, in order to reduce deviation over time.

- ## Software System

    A software system managed by GitOps includes:

    1. One or more runtime environments consisting of resources under management
    1. The management agents within each runtime
    1. Policies for controlling access and management of repositories, deployments, runtimes

- ## State Store

    A system for storing immutable versions of [desired state](#desired-state) declarations.
    This state store should provide access control and auditing on the changes to the Desired State.
    Git, from which GitOps derives its name, is the canonical example used as this state store but any other system that meets these criteria may be used.
    In all cases, these state stores must be properly configured and precautions must be taken to comply with requirements set out in the GitOps Principles.

- ## Intermediate State Store
    A system for storing a copy of the declarations that are mastered in the State Store. This system's purpose is intended to bridge the gap in availability between that of the State Store and the expected availability to make configuration changes to the Software System. The Intermediate State Store will offer an availability the same as or near enough to that of the users' expectations to update configuration in the Software System.

Where an Intermediate State Store is used, Reconciliation is used between the State Store and the Intermediate State Store and then again between the Intermediate State Store and the Software System.

- ## Feedback

    Open GitOps follows [control-theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory) and operates in a closed-loop. In control theory, feedback represents how previous attempts to apply a desired state have affected the actual state. For example if the desired state requires more resources than exist in a system, the software agent may make attempts to add resources, to automatically rollback to a previous version, or to send alerts to human operators.

- ## Break the Glass
The process of editing the Intermediate State Store directly in the event that a configuration update needs to be made to the Software System but the State Store is unavailable.
