This repository holds lasting documents for the OpenGitOps project, which should be versioned and [released](https://github.com/open-gitops/documents/releases) together.
The `main` branch is a work in progress, including:

- [GitOps Principles](./PRINCIPLES.md)
- [GitOps Glossary](./GLOSSARY.md)

See the [releases](https://github.com/open-gitops/documents/releases) page for published versions.
Note the difference between pre-releases and full releases, defined by the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) scheme followed by this repo.
See [open milestones](https://github.com/open-gitops/documents/milestones) for planned future releases.

Please find translations of the principles as well as the glossary in the [i18n](./i18n/) folder.
