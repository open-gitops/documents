This repository holds lasting documents for the OpenGitOps project, which should be versioned and [released](https://github.com/open-gitops/documents/releases) together.
The `main` branch is a work in progress, including:

- [GitOps Principles](./PRINCIPLES.md)
- [GitOps Glossary](./GLOSSARY.md)

See the [releases](https://github.com/open-gitops/documents/releases) page for published versions.
Note the difference between pre-releases and full releases, defined by the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) scheme followed by this repo.
See [open milestones](https://github.com/open-gitops/documents/milestones) for planned future releases.

Please find translations of the principles as well as the glossary in the [i18n](./i18n/) folder.

## About OpenGitOps

OpenGitOps is a [CNCF Sandbox project](https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/) for lasting programs, documents and code from the [GitOps Working Group](https://github.com/cncf/tag-app-delivery/tree/main/gitops-wg).

## About the GitOps Working Group

The GitOps Working Group is a WG under the [CNCF App Delivery TAG](https://github.com/cncf/tag-app-delivery), with a focus to clearly define a vendor-neutral, principle-led meaning of GitOps. This will establish a foundation for interoperability between tools, conformance, and certification.
It is an open public working group welcoming anyone who would like to join and help.
See [How to Get Involved](https://github.com/cncf/tag-app-delivery/tree/main/gitops-wg#community).

## Code of Conduct

The OpenGitOps community follows the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/open-gitops/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
