# CONTRIBUTING

This repository hosts lasting documents for the OpenGitOps project, which are versioned and released together.

Before contributing, please review the [OpenGitOps Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/open-gitops/community-health-files/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). This document provides essential details on how to contribute, including information about discussions, meetings, the Code of Conduct, and other important guidelines for engaging with the OpenGitOps community.

## Contribution Guidelines

In addition to contributions to the ongoing evolution of the GitOps [Principles](https://github.com/open-gitops/documents/blob/v1.0.0/PRINCIPLES.md) and [Glossary](https://github.com/open-gitops/documents/blob/v1.0.0/GLOSSARY.md), OpenGitOps is looking for additional types of content to help new and existing GitOps practitioners learn from each other on their journey.

These may include content initially envisioned in the [Work Products](https://github.com/cncf/tag-app-delivery/blob/main/gitops-wg/charter.md#work-products-wip) section of the GitOps Working Group charter, such as methodologies and approaches documents, a GitOps landscape document, or working examples for getting started. Other content, such as white papers, case studies, architectural patterns, tool and technology comparisons, or tutorials, are also good candidates for inclusion. Use your imagination!

## Discussion and Approval

We encourage you to first discuss any ideas or questions asynchronously with the GitOps community using [OpenGitOps project discussions](https://github.com/open-gitops/project/discussions). These discussions are highlighted in the twice-monthly community meetings, and sometimes special teams are formed to collaborate on specific content topics.

## Minimum Acceptance Criteria

All content in this repo must meet the following acceptance criteria to be considered for inclusion:

* **Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO):** Commit sign-off is required for all contributions.
* **Copyright:** Copyright must be assigned to OpenGitOps / CNCF project.
* **Originality:** Content must not be a duplicate. For version changes in technology, submit a new version of an existing article.
* **Informational:** Content must be informational and not promotional. Tutorials and case studies of vendor technology are allowed, but promotional content is limited to one line and one link (excluding any links to free trials) at the start or end of the content.
* **Branding:** Content should not contain branding for anything other than the OpenGitOps project.
* **Format:** Content must be in markdown format.

Pull requests must also receive at least two approvals from project maintainers.

We look forward to your contributions!
